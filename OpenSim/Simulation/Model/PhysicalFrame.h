* Attributes of a Body (its center-of-mass, geometry, ...) are located in the
* Body frame. Bodies are connected by Joints and Constraints and Forces are 
* readily applied to them. A location that represents an offset from the Body
* frame, can also be a PhysicalFrame (e.g. a PhysicalOffsetFrame).

    underlies the PhysicalFrame. For example, Solvers operate on the System and
    not on the OpenSim modeling abstractions, such as Frames.
